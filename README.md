HACKLAB 2.0

You can find the Processing and Arduino codes for my project "Reader Rabbit". 
Any additional code is found from the github of Ashley James Brown (https://github.com/ashleyjamesbrown).

Codes for some of the workshops can be found on my wordpress page (http://dmvm.coventry.ac.uk/~kaleevt/hacklab2/) where I've blogged about the given tasks.
